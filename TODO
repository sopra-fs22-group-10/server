To Do:
    ENtities:
        -Change Template to Deck Relationship
        -Create Change Template or Delete Template Function/Endpoint:
            Make check that only Template can be changed if no cards are present
            Ask Question
    Authorization:
        -Create Authorization Checks for all requests

    -Add Deck Function should create new Deck instead of adding te real deck, since if two Users have the same Deck, if one is changed the other does aswell.
